# Orchard Skill Test - Ryan Barrogo

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

I used Nuxt3 and Tailwind for this test as these are the latest tech that's being used in the market.

## Setup

```bash
# npm

Locally preview production build:
